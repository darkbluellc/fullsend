                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    Fullsend (&ldquo;the Application&rdquo;) is a text message paging and communication platform developed and operated by Darkblue, LLC (&ldquo;Darkblue,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;).

                </ul>
                <p>

                <h4>Data Ownership and Disclosure</h4>
                <p>
                    Darkblue retains ownership and control of all data collected through Fullsend. We may disclose data—including message content and logs—to the contracting organization that engaged Darkblue to provide the Application, upon a valid and reasonable request. We may also disclose data as required by law, court order, or governmental request. We do not otherwise sell or share user data with third parties.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
                <p>
                    Fullsend uses cookies and similar technologies for login sessions, authentication management, and access control. These cookies are essential to the Application&rsquo;s operation and cannot be disabled without affecting functionality. In the future, cookies and related technologies may support single sign-on (SSO) or other authentication integrations.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Third-Party Service Providers</h4>
                <p>
                    To deliver core functionality (e.g., SMS transmission and hosting), Fullsend may rely on third-party service providers. These providers process data as necessary to operate the Application. We do not authorize them to use data for unrelated purposes.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Security</h4>
                <p>
                    Data transmitted to and from Fullsend is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS. Data is not encrypted at rest. Access to administrative and operational data is restricted to authorized Darkblue personnel subject to authentication controls. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and you acknowledge inherent security risks.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Data Retention</h4>
                <p>
                    Darkblue retains all data indefinitely. We do not delete, anonymize, or otherwise alter stored information except as required by law or at our sole discretion. Requests for deletion or modification from users or contracting organizations are not honored, except where legally mandated.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Your Choices and Rights</h4>
                <p>
                    Because Fullsend is provided to contracting organizations and Darkblue retains ownership of data, users do not have a right to request deletion, correction, or export of their data. Questions may be directed to fullsend@wemsapp.com.
                </p>
                
                <h4>U.S.-Only Service; Children</h4>
                <p>
                    The Application is intended for U.S. use only and is not directed to individuals under 18 years of age.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Legal Basis and Jurisdiction</h4>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy and any disputes arising from it are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Claims or disputes must be brought exclusively in the courts of Massachusetts.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Data Breach Notification</h4>
                <p>
                    In the event of a data breach or unauthorized access, Darkblue will comply with applicable legal requirements for breach notification and will notify affected parties if and as legally required.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h4>
                <p>
                    We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Updates take effect immediately upon posting to the Fullsend website or Application. Continued use after posting constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
