                <p>
                    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Fullsend application (“the Application”) operated by Darkblue, LLC (“Darkblue,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

                </p>
                <p>
                    Fullsend is a hosted text-message paging and communication service provided to contracting organizations. Users may access the system under accounts authorized by those organizations and administered by Darkblue.
                </p>
                <h4>Eligibility and Use</h4>

                </p>
                <p>
                    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity under your account. If you believe your account has been compromised, you must notify Darkblue immediately.

                        </li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>

                    </ul>
                    Violations of these provisions may result in suspension or termination of access, at Darkblue’s sole discretion.

                <h4>Data Ownership and Usage</h4>
                <p>
                    All information entered into or generated by the Application—including messages, recipients, senders, timestamps, and logs—is retained indefinitely and owned by Darkblue, LLC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Darkblue may disclose such data, in full or in part, to the contracting organization upon a valid and reasonable request, and may also disclose data where required by law, court order, or government authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users acknowledge that they have no ownership, deletion, or modification rights over stored data except as may be required by applicable law.

                <h4>Service Availability</h4>
                <p>
                    Fullsend is provided on an &ldquo;as-is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as-available&rdquo; basis. While Darkblue strives to ensure reliability and uptime, we make no guarantees regarding availability, performance, or error-free operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maintenance, updates, outages, or third-party issues may temporarily affect accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Darkblue may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Application at any time without notice or liability.

                <h4>Security and Authentication</h4>
                <p>
                    Access to Fullsend requires authentication. Currently, authentication is provided via username and password; other methods such as API keys or single sign-on (SSO) may be added in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data is encrypted in transit but not encrypted at rest. Users acknowledge and accept these limitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Darkblue employs reasonable administrative and technical safeguards but cannot guarantee absolute security.
                </p>
                <h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
                <p>
                    Fullsend may rely on third-party service providers (for example, for SMS transmission, hosting, or other infrastructure).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Darkblue does not control and is not responsible for the practices or reliability of these external services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use of the Application constitutes consent to necessary data processing by such providers to enable functionality.

                <h4>Termination</h4>
                <p>
                    Darkblue may suspend or terminate your access to the Application at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that it believes violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful to its interests, the system, or other users. Upon termination, your right to access the Application immediately ceases.

                <p>

                <p>
                    We may revise these Terms from time to time. Updated Terms take effect immediately upon posting to the Fullsend website or application. Your continued use of the Application after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
